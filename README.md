De-Re-Basic
===========

A repository for the BASIC! manual, De Re BASIC!

Git can not merge this file. For this reason, collaborator  mrleavitt is the only person that should push changes to the manual

### Why this fork?

This fork was made because programmers using accessibility software, specifically Talkback in my case, find that the screen reader has a hard time parsing a monolithic file. 

As a result, I have converted the manual to 58 separate html files which should be easier for screen reading software to handle. 

I have converted the document with Python, so there may be errors in the links, but limited testing shows the TOC (in index.html) seems to have been converted well.
